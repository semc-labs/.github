## Hello from the SEMC team!

[![The I/O flying to Io](/profile/banner.svg)](https://github.com/semc-labs)

At SEMC we love using open source methods and research ideas to
improve software quality and reliablity *in space* ðŸŒŒ. We are 
big on composable software: functional, typed, immutable. A part
of the [Nexus Aurora](https://nexusaurora.org/) team, we develop
a variety of software, from [systems-level robotics](https://github.com/semc-labs/mdrs-ssam)
to [high-level configuration languages](https://github.com/semc-labs/Salo).

**We're open to contributors**, so if you want to shape the future
of the software industry working with innovative teammates, [join us](https://discord.gg/uxGFjp65pK)!
